# Hexboard Testing Framework

## Overview

The hexboard library now includes a comprehensive Jest-based testing framework for the core functionality (excluding 3D rendering).

## Test Structure

```
tests/
└── core/
    ├── coordinates.test.ts    # Coordinate system tests
    ├── cell.test.ts          # Cell interface tests
    ├── hexGrid.test.ts       # Main HexGrid class tests
    ├── entity.test.ts        # Entity system tests
    └── integration.test.ts   # Cross-component integration tests
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Coverage

The framework includes test stubs for:

### Coordinates System

- ✅ Axial to cubic coordinate conversion
- ✅ Coordinate validation
- ✅ Edge cases (large values, floating point precision)

### Cell System

- ✅ Cell and CellDefinition interfaces
- ✅ Custom property type safety
- ✅ Generic constraint validation

### HexGrid Core

- ✅ Grid construction and initialization
- ✅ Cell management (add, remove, update, query)
- ✅ Coordinate validation integration
- ✅ Hex ring generation
- ✅ Utility methods
- ✅ Performance and memory management
- ✅ Edge cases and future-proofing

### Entity System

- ✅ Entity interface definitions
- ✅ Entity-grid integration
- ✅ Future pathfinding preparation

### Integration Tests

- ✅ Cross-component interactions
- ✅ Type safety across all components
- ✅ Performance with complex operations
- ✅ Error handling and rollback scenarios
- ✅ Future feature preparation (pathfinding, units, resources)

## Test Implementation Status

**Current Status**: All test stubs created and passing ✅
**Next Step**: Implement actual test logic by replacing `expect(true).toBe(true)` with real assertions

## Configuration

- **Framework**: Jest 29.5 with TypeScript support
- **Coverage Target**: 80% across branches, functions, lines, statements
- **Exclusions**: 3D rendering code (`src/rendering/**`)
- **Test Environment**: Node.js

## Benefits

1. **Bug Prevention**: Catches coordinate system bugs, duplicate cells, invalid operations
2. **Regression Testing**: Ensures changes don't break existing functionality
3. **Future-Proofing**: Tests are designed to catch issues when adding pathfinding, units, etc.
4. **Type Safety**: Validates generic constraints and custom property handling
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Includes stress tests for large grids

## Development Workflow

1. **TDD Ready**: Use `npm run test:watch` for test-driven development
2. **Coverage Tracking**: Use `npm run test:coverage` to ensure comprehensive testing
3. **CI/CD Ready**: Framework is ready for continuous integration pipelines
